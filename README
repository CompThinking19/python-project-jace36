This project is a choose your own adventure, horror game that was inspired by women related crimes.
As a fan of true crime and horror, I wanted to combine my love for the two by making this game.
This game is supposed to show how scary being a women in this world is and how they have to think about getting out of scary situations all the time.
If they slip up and make a mistake, it can end with the women being hurt or killed.
So, this game is meant to bring awareness to the rising rate of women related crime.
I only completed one level of the game, but I hope to one day finish and have the ending credit of the game print out statistics of women related crimes
This way, the game will leave a lasting impact on the people playing it

Project narrative:
As someone who knew very little about coding, making this game was beyond difficult at first.
I looked through many models of how to a create your own adventure game should look like, until I found one that actually worked
However, since I created many sub questions in my questions, I ran into some difficulties.
Sometimes the code would skip over those questions, wouldn't remember if the player answered that question later on in the game, or kept repeating the question.
So, I had to create new variables that described the scenes going on and items that I wanted to be able access, which allowed my sub questions to run smoothly and stopped them from repeating themselves.
I was very fortunate to have a friend who knew code to help me fix the problems in my code and show me what I can do to improve it.
If I didn't have them, I don't think this code would even Run
With this first level done, I know how a completed guideline on how to go forward in completing this game
