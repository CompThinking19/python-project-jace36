Your code runs and does more or less exactly what it needs to do, which is great. I think you're just about done with the basics of this project. As I was running it, there were a few places where the loops didn't seem as if they were breaking properly, and I got the same question a few different times after already answering it. The code itself is also well commented. In response to your final comment, no, the code doesn't remember that you grabbed an item currently, but it's easy for you to make it so: just create a variable called grabbed_item and set it to True. If possible, you might also consider ways to make this code a bit DRYer. The nested while loops work, but if you were to wrap some of this in a function, the errors I mentioned of getting the same prompt multiple times might not happen so often.
